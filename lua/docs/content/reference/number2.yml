    samples:
      - code: |
          local n1 = Number2(1, 0, 0)

          n2.X = 10
          print(n1.X) -- now n1.X == 10

          -- using Copy:
          local n1 = Number2(1, 0, 0)
          local n2 = n1:Copy() -- n2 is a copy of n1, they're not the same Number2
          n2.X = 10
          print(n1.X) -- n1.X is still 1
